Serverless collection solution to collect Duo security logs in to Sumo logic

# Deprecation Notice

This legacy solution to pull logs from Dup to Sumo Logic has been replaced with a dedicated Cloud-to-Cloud Integration Framework source. We recommend customers use the Duo Cloud-to-Cloud source instead of this legacy Python collection method.

### Sumo Logic App for Duo Security
Duo provides two-factor authentication, endpoint remediation, and secure single sign-on tools. The Sumo Logic App for Duo Security helps you monitor your Duo accountâ€™s authentication logs, administrator logs, and telephony logs. The dashboards provide insight into failed and successful authentications, events breakdown by applications, factors, and users, geo-location of events, admin activities, outliers, threat analysis of authentication, and administrator events.

### Log Types
Sumo Logic App for Duo Security uses the following logs. See Duo's [documentation](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#logs) for details of the log schema.

- Authentication Logs
- Administrator Logs
- Telephony Logs

### Collect Logs for Duo Security Via AWS Lambda
1. Create an HTTP Logs and Metrics Source.
2. Download Lambda Function code and dependencies; archive the resulting directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-duo-security.git
pip3 install --target ./sumologic-duo-security requests
pip3 install --target ./sumologic-duo-security duo_client
cd sumologic-duo-security && find . ! -path ".git" | zip ./archive.zip -@
```

3. Upload the resulting `archive.zip` to AWS Lambda Console and create a Lambda function.
4. Define Environment Variables for the Lambda Function.
5. Add a time-based trigger for the Lambda function.

### Collect Logs for Duo Security Via CronJob task deployed at Kubernetes Cluster
1. Deploy the secret `duocreds` using following kubectl cmd, and replace S_KEY, I_KEY, HOST with [Duo Admin API Creds](https://duo.com/docs/adminapi#logs). Replace COLL_ENDPOINT with Sumo Logic HTTP URL

```
kubectl create secret generic duocreds --from-literal=S_KEY=<REPLACE> --from-literal=I_KEY=<REPLACE> --from-literal=HOST=<REPLACE> --from-literal=COLL_ENDPOINT=<REPLACE> --from-literal=SCAN_INTERVAL_IN_SEC=300
```

2. Run following cmd, this will create 5 mins cronjob to fetch Duo logs and send to Sumo Logic HTTP URL

```kubectl apply -f https://sumologic-app-data.s3.amazonaws.com/Duo/hw_dep.yaml```

3. Verify

```
   kubectl get pods  | grep duo
   kubectl get jobs
````
